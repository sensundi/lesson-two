## Homework Checklist

If you did the homework [last week][lesson-one], you should already have a virtualenv that you can use this week.

- [ ] [Fork this repository][gh-fork]
- [ ] Clone the repo to your own machine
- [ ] Normalise the model we created in class by creating new [Django models][dj-models] that better express the
      relationships. You'll need to add [ForeignKey relationships][dj-fk] between your models and our existing one.
- [ ] Update `admin.py` so all your new models show
- [ ] Bonus Points: Use [Django's migrations][dj-migrations] in a way that allows us to keep existing data in out model

When you've completed some or all of the homework please make a [Pull Request][gh-pr] against this repository.
If you submit your work before Wednesday evening we'll give you feedback before the next class.
